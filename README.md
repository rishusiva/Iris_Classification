# Iris_Classification

## Overview
Iris flower dataset is classified into different species using both Supervised and Unsupervised Algorithms. Hyper parameter tuning is also done to find best algorithm with best parameters.

## Supervised Algorithms Used
* SVC
* KFold Cross Validation
* Random Forest Classifier
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree Classifier

## Unsupervised Algorithms Used
* KMeans Clustering

## Hyper Parameter Tuning
* GridSearchCV
* RandomizedSearchCV

## Prerequisites
* Python 3 
* an IDE (preferably Jupyter Notebook)
* Pandas 
* Numpy 
* Matplotlib 
* Sklearn 
* Seaborn

All the external dependencies can be installed by using ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
